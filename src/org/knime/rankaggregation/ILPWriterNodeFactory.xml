    <shortDescription>
        Writes data into a file in Integer Linear Program format (ILP).
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node saves data to a file or to a remote location denoted by an URL in LPX format for LIPS (.lpx) or LP format for SCIP (.lp).
            Linear Program Solver (LiPS) is an optimization package intended for solving linear, integer
            and goal programming problems. SCIP is currently one of the fastest non-commercial solvers for mixed integer programming (MIP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP).
            In the configuration dialog, specify a format to generate the file(.lpx or .lp ), the variant(Original Formulation, Reduced Variables Formulation or Reduced Variables and Constraints Formulation) and a
            valid destination location. When executed, the node writes the data, coming through its input port in the
            selected format and variant, into the specified location.
            <br/>
            Note that if the destination location is a remote URL not all options are available because in general it's
            not possible to determine whether the remote location exists. In this case it will always be overwritten.
        </intro>
        <option name="Format">
            Select the format file.
            LPX format create the model in algebraic input mode for LIPS (.lpx) and LP format create the model in algebraic input mode for SCIP (.lp) 
        </option>
        <option name="Variant">
            Select the variant to generate the file.
            "Original Formulation" is the original formulation of the problem, "Reduced Variables Formulation" is an alternative formulation to the original formulation with reduced
            variables and "Reduced Variables and Constraints Formulation" is an alternative formulation to the original formulation with reduced
            variables and constraints.
        </option>
        <option name="File Chooser">
            Enter a valid file name or URL. You can also choose a previously selected location from the drop-down list,
            or select a local file from the "Browse..." dialog.
        </option>
        <option name="Overwrite OK">
            If unchecked, the node refuses to execute when the output file exists (prevent unintentional overwrite).
